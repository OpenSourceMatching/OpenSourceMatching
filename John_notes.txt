Options and need to do POCs / more research

1. Server Side Events: send data to client from server. Probably serverless computer and deploy with vercel.
2. 2 repos - one for server and one for client. Deploy separately
3. Use React Query, SWR, custom polling, or something else to get the latest data. Serverless compute and deploy with vercel.
4. Use useSWRSubscription and have a websocket. Keep it all in nextJS. Serverless compute and deploy with vercel. (not sure this is what useSWR is built for)
5. 1 repo and deploy server and client separately
