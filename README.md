# Open Forge
If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together. Find like-minded developers for your open source projects.

## Inspiration
The open source community's greatest strength is its size and active community. But for developers less entrenched in the community, it can be a tough, intimidating world to first enter.

OpenForge allows developers to connect, start projects from the ground up, or team up on existing products.

We want to encourage more people to develop open source products, and we firmly believe in the power of a team.

## What it does
OpenForge is a portal that allows you to find like-minded developers to build open source products. Create a profile and tell the community about yourself - what technologies you like, the areas you're passionate about, and any projects you're currently working on.

Use OpenForge's search feature to find and connect with other developers to start working as a team.

## How we built it
OpenForge is built with Next.js, MongoDB, Styled-Components, and Descope authentication.

## Challenges we ran into
This was our first time building a full-stack Next.js application and the initial set-up took a bit of time as we navigated a new technology. 

## What we learned
On the technical side, we learned that Descope is a must-have. It simplified the development process and saved us significant time.

After talking with developers at Thursday of Dev Week, we realized we're not alone in feeling this way about open source. While our app is still certainly a work in progress, we're excited about the opportunities to connect people and build the next generation of open source software.
